The client-to-socket mapping is done at multiple levels, depending on whether you're referring to low-level OS networking or application-level server handling:

1. OS-Level (TCP/IP Stack)

When a client connects to a server:

The OS maintains a mapping between client IP/port and the server socket.

The server's listening socket (bind() and listen()) accepts new connections.

When a client connects, the OS creates a new socket (file descriptor) for that client.

This socket maps the client's IP & port to a server-side socket.


2. Application-Level (Server-Side Code)

In a server application (like in Python, Java, or Node.js), the client-socket mapping is often handled in a hashmap or dictionary to track client connections:

In multi-threaded or event-driven servers, each client socket is mapped to a connection object or a worker thread/process.

Example in Python (socketserver):

clients = {}  # Dictionary to map client addresses to sockets

def handle_client(client_socket, client_address):
    clients[client_address] = client_socket  # Store mapping
    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        print(f"Received from {client_address}: {data}")

    del clients[client_address]  # Remove when client disconnects
    client_socket.close()


3. In Load Balancers & Reverse Proxies

If a load balancer (like Nginx, HAProxy) is used, it also maintains a mapping of client connections to backend servers.

This ensures consistent client-server mapping for session persistence.


Conclusion

At the OS level, mapping is done in the kernelâ€™s TCP stack.

At the application level, mapping is usually done using hashmaps, lists, or connection pools to track active clients.
