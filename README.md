# Web Server Performance Benchmark

## Overview
This project implements a basic web server in three different models:
1. **Single-Threaded** – Handles one request at a time.
2. **Multi-Threaded** – Spawns a new thread for each request.
3. **Thread Pool** – Uses a fixed number of worker threads.

The goal is to compare their performance under load and identify the most efficient model.

## Performance Benchmarking

To evaluate the efficiency of different server implementations, we used the following **load-testing command**:

```sh
seq 500 | xargs -P 50 -I {} curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Request {}: %{time_total} s\n" http://localhost:8010
```

- `seq 500` → Generates 500 requests.
- `xargs -P 50` → Runs 50 requests in parallel.
- `curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Request {}: %{time_total} s\n"` → Measures response time for each request.

### **Benchmark Results**

| Metric                    | Single-Threaded | Multi-Threaded | Thread Pool |
|---------------------------|---------------:|--------------:|------------:|
| **Avg Response Time (s)**  | 4.745           | 0.991          | 1.001       |
| **Min Response Time (s)**  | 0.162           | 0.331          | 0.313       |
| **Max Response Time (s)**  | 5.447           | 1.562          | 1.616       |
| **Std Dev (s)**            | 0.882           | 0.271          | 0.286       |

### **Analysis & Conclusion**
- The **Multi-Threaded model** shows the best stability with consistent response times and the lowest variance.
- The **Thread Pool model** performs similarly but with slightly higher variability.
- The **Single-Threaded model** struggles with scalability, exhibiting significant delays under heavy load.

### **Verdict**  
🚀 **The Multi-Threaded model demonstrated the best overall performance with fast and consistent response times, making it the most efficient in this benchmark.

⚠️ However, it's important to note that the Multi-Threaded model can become less efficient under extremely high concurrency due to context switching overhead. As thread counts increase, the CPU may spend more time switching between threads rather than executing them, potentially impacting performance.

📈 **The Thread Pool model offers a more controlled approach by limiting the number of concurrent threads, which may provide better scalability in scenarios with very high traffic.

📉 **The Single-Threaded model, while simple, struggles with scalability and is unsuitable for handling large numbers of concurrent requests

## Theory
The client-to-socket mapping is done at multiple levels, depending on whether you're referring to low-level OS networking or application-level server handling:

### **1. OS-Level (TCP/IP Stack)**
- The OS maintains a mapping between the client IP/port and the server socket.
- The server’s listening socket (via `bind()` and `listen()`) accepts new connections.
- When a client connects, the OS creates a new socket (file descriptor) for that client. This socket maps the client's IP & port to a server-side socket.

### **2. Application-Level (Server-Side Code)**
- In server applications (like Python, Java, or Node.js), client-socket mapping is often handled in a hashmap or dictionary to track client connections.
- In multi-threaded or event-driven servers, each client socket is mapped to a connection object or worker thread/process.

**Example in Python (socketserver):**

```python
clients = {}  # Dictionary to map client addresses to sockets

def handle_client(client_socket, client_address):
    clients[client_address] = client_socket  # Store mapping
    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        print(f"Received from {client_address}: {data}")

    del clients[client_address]  # Remove when client disconnects
    client_socket.close()
```

### **3. In Load Balancers & Reverse Proxies**
- Load balancers (like Nginx, HAProxy) maintain a mapping of client connections to backend servers.
- This ensures consistent client-server mapping for session persistence.

### **Conclusion**
- At the **OS level**, mapping is done in the kernel’s TCP stack.
- At the **application level**, mapping is usually done using hashmaps, lists, or connection pools to track active clients.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing additional concurrency models like async I/O for improved efficiency.
- Expanding the test with higher concurrency levels for deeper performance insights.
